# emart-app
# easy setup with docker-compose
just: run docker-compose up
and it will run automatically

some common issues to run into:
1) running [docker-compose up] normally on the terminal, it needs to run on a linux machine
2) not having docker installed: if u dont have docker installed it wont work so you need to install docker
3) not having docker compose downloaded: if you dont have docker compose downloaded then you need to download it because it wont run without docker-compose
